            <h1>Hey! I'm Ryan.</h1>
            <p>Currently a second-year Computer Science student, I'm passionate about learning and challenging myself intellectually and physically. I have studied Japanese and French and am currently learning Greek, with aspirations to master even more languages. I enjoy road and mountain biking, as well as weightlifting. I absolutely love mathematics, and I leverage my analytical problem-solving skills in everything I do. Aside from my academic pursuits, I work as a mechanic at Trek Bikes. Here on my portfolio, I'll be posting my projects, academic updates, and experience in the field of computer science!</p>
